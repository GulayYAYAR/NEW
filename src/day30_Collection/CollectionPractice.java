List and Set both are interfaces. They both extends Collection interface.
The important differences between set and list are:

1.Duplicate Objects
The main difference between List and Set is that List allows duplicates while
 Set doesn't allow duplicates.

2.Order
List is an ordered collection it maintains the insertion order,
which means upon displaying the list content it will display the elements in the same order in
which they got inserted into the list.

Set is an unordered collection, it doesnâ€™t maintain any order.
 There are few implementations of Set which maintains the order
 such as LinkedHashSet (It maintains the elements in insertion order).
 treeset will sort
 hashset will sort in hashset logic

3.Null elements
List allows any number of null elements. Set can have only a single null elements at most.
--Treseet wont allow even one null
